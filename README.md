An example of a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements in the sequence.

In order to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two sequences, we have to find a subsequence with a maximum length, that is common to both sequences. As an example, if two strings "ace" and "abcde" are given, the longest common subsequence is 3, which is "ace".
